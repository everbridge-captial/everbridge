# Users Module

This module is responsible for managing user data within the CMS. It provides endpoints for retrieving and updating user information.

## Purpose

The `UsersModule` provides a way to interact with user entities. While user creation is handled by the `AuthModule` during the registration process, this module allows for viewing and modifying existing user data.
